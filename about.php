	<p>This site is meant serve as a successor to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v0yhceinMGr5alNekOxEkYCxXcYUsbtzMRVMezxbcVY/edit">Custom Golden Map Strawberry List</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FesTb6qkgMz-dCn7YdioRydToWSQNTg1axFEIHU4FF8/edit#gid=0">Farewell Golden Collectors List</a> as a new archive for deathless achievements in Farewell and Modded Celeste. The main goal of this site is to archive and maintain all the recorded golden clears of both Farewell from vanilla Celeste and modded maps and to hopefully to encourage people to go for golden strawberries themselves.</p>
	<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
	<p>The most active and consistent way to contact the team for matters related to the list is Discord. This can be done via <a href="https://discord.gg/celeste">the official Celeste Discord</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/GeJvmMycaC">the list specific Discord</a>.</p>
	<p>Of course, having Discord as the only means of contact is undesirable to some. You may also contact one of the list members with <a href="mailto:goldberries@riseup.net">this email address</a> where further communication can be established.</p>
